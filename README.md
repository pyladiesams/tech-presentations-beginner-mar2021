# An introduction to Delivering Technical Presentations with Confidence

### Level: Beginner

### Presentation: TBA

## Workshop description

Giving good presentations is an important skill to have and improve. It will make it
easier to share your knowledge, inspire, and persuade others. But if you feel like me -
a not so natural storyteller - it can seem difficult to create good presentations and
keep the attention of the audience. As a result, I've spent hours figuring out the best
hacks on how to structure presentations and feel more confident delivering them. I look
forward to sharing them with you in the workshop!

During this session, you will learn how to structure technical presentations to avoid
common pitfalls that result in losing the attention of your audience. Additionally, you
will get tips & tricks on how to deliver your presentation with confidence and how to
tweak your talk for an online audience.
