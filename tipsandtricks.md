## Quick Presentation Tips

- Looking for nice images for your presentation? You can find free stock photos at Pexel
  or unsplash. You can also find many icons online. There are online tools to make the
  background transparent or change the color to fit your presentation style.
- Use tools such as [Slido](https://www.sli.do/),
  [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/), or [Kahoot](https://kahoot.it/) to engage
  your audience during an online presentation.
- Stand during your (online) presentation to give a more energetic presentation.
- Practice your presentation by recording yourself via Zoom.
- Keep forgetting to look at the camera during online presentations? Add a post-it
  sticker next to your camera to remind you.
- Nervous for the Q&A? Think of a few questions that might get asked. Prepare their
  answers. Usually some of these questions will come up in some variation. That way you
  are already prepared.
- Give your host a question to ask at the end. This can be something you would have
  liked to mention, but did not fit in your presentation. This way you can still give
  your audience this information, you are prepared for the question, and it will help
  out the host if there are no questions from the audience.
- Don’t be afraid to say you don’t know the answer to the question. You can say “That’s
  a really good question. I have to say I don’t know.”
- Be you! You are taking the step to stand in front of an audience and share your
  knowledge. You should be proud of yourself. And even though practice is important,
  make sure to stay authentic and true to yourself. Because you, my friend, are amazing!
