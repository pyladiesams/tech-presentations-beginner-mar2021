# Additional Tips & Tricks
In this document you will find some additional tips & tricks to help you when making your presentation. 

## Story Structure Guide
Answer these questions before creating your presentation to guide your story.
 
1. Who is my audience?

    *What is their background? How much do they already know about this topic? Is there something in the title or
     description of my talk that might have attracted them to it?*

2. What's in it for you? (WIIFY)

    *Why should my audience care? How would the information I give help them? Include this information when introducing
     the subject.*

3. What is my motivation?

    *Why do I care about this topic? Why do I want to give people more knowledge on this topic?*

4. What is the main point I want to make?

    *If there is one thing that my audience will remember from my presentation, what should that be?*

5. Write down a list of content that you can mention on this topic

    *What information can be relevant for this talk? What is information I would have liked to know if I came to my own
     talk?*
 
6. Divide the items in three concepts

    *The average person's working memory is somewhere between three and four items. This means that we should not
 introduce too much new information all at once. Can I divide my list into 3 categories or concepts? Anything that
  falls outside of these 3, I will drop. Also, let's make sure each concept does not have too many items.*

7. Write down the main takeaway for each concept

    *For each of these 3 concepts, what is the most important takeaway for the audience? I can use this in my
     conclusion.*




## Quick Presentation Tips
- Looking for nice images for your presentation? You can find free stock photos at Pexel or
 unsplash. You can also find many icons online. There are online tools to make the background transparent or change
  the color to fit your presentation style.
- Stand during your (online) presentation to give a more energetic presentation.
- Practice your presentation by recording yourself via Zoom.
- Nervous for the Q&A? Think of a few questions that might get asked. Prepare their answers. Usually some of these questions will come up in some variation. That way you are already prepared.
- Give your host a question to ask at the end. This can be something you would have liked to mention, but did not fit in your presentation. This way you can still give your audience this information, you are prepared for the question, and it will help out the host if there are no questions from the audience.
- Don’t be afraid to say you don’t know the answer to the question. You can say “That’s a really good question. I have to say I don’t know.”
