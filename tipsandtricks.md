In this document you will find some additional tips & tricks to help you when making your presentation. 


## Quick Presentation Tips
- Looking for nice images for your presentation? You can find free stock photos at Pexel or
 unsplash. You can also find many icons online. There are online tools to make the background transparent or change
  the color to fit your presentation style.
- Stand during your (online) presentation to give a more energetic presentation.
- Practice your presentation by recording yourself via Zoom.
- Keep forgetting to look at the camera during online presentations? Add a post-it sticker next to your camera to remind
 you.
- Nervous for the Q&A? Think of a few questions that might get asked. Prepare their answers. Usually some of these questions will come up in some variation. That way you are already prepared.
- Give your host a question to ask at the end. This can be something you would have liked to mention, but did not fit in your presentation. This way you can still give your audience this information, you are prepared for the question, and it will help out the host if there are no questions from the audience.
- Don’t be afraid to say you don’t know the answer to the question. You can say “That’s a really good question. I have to say I don’t know.”
