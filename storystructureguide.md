## Story Structure Guide
Answer these questions before creating your presentation to guide your story.
 
1. Who is my audience?

    *What is their background? How much do they already know about this topic? Is there something in the title or
     description of my talk that might have attracted them to it? Keep this in mind at every slide. Can I assume they
      know this information or these terms?*

2. What's in it for you? (WIIFY)

    *Why should my audience care? How would the information I give help them? Include this information when introducing
     the subject. This can also be used in the presentation description*

3. What is my motivation?

    *Why do I care about this topic? Why do I want to give people more knowledge on this topic? Use this when feeling
     nervous (or excited!)*

4. What is the main point I want to make?

    *If there is one thing that my audience will remember from my presentation, what should that be? Use this at the
     start and/or to close the presentation.*

5. Write down a list of content that you can mention on this topic

    *What information can be relevant to share in this talk? What is information I would have liked to know if I
     came to my own talk? What examples or stories can I give for this topic?*
 
6. Divide the items in three concepts

    *The average person's working memory is somewhere between three and four items. This means that we should not
 introduce too much new information all at once. Can I divide my list into 3 categories or concepts? Anything that
  falls outside of these 3, I will drop. Also, let's make sure each concept does not have too many items.*

7. Write down the main takeaway for each concept

    *For each of these 3 concepts, what is the most important takeaway for the audience? Use this to structure the
     story of each concept. This can also be used in the conclusion.*


#### Example

It can always help to have an example of how to fill out questions. 
After the presentation, I will add the answers to the questions that I used to create the presentation itself.
